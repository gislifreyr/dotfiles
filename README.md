**dotfiles**
===================


### About

This is, as you can see, a repo of all my 'dotfiles'. The 'magic' script takes care of all the magic with a little help from git and stow.
Inspired by *samueljon's*  [vim-config-and-plugin-sync][1], *mathiasbynens* [dotfiles][2] and many more that I can't think of.
